    """A span is an individual timed event which forms a node of the trace
    tree. Each span has its name, span id and parent id. The parent id
    indicates the causal relationships between the individual spans in a
    single distributed trace. Span that does not have a parent id is called
    root span. All spans associated with a specific trace also share a common
    trace id. Spans do not need to be continuous, there can be gaps between
    two spans.
